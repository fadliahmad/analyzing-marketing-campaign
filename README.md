# Analyzing Marketing Campaign

This is a marketing campaign use case analysis. The dataset used is provided by datacamp in the Analyzing Marketing Campaign with pandas module.

In this project, I try to repeat what I have learned from the module with some changes and improvisations so this module and the story of this data can be more readable.
