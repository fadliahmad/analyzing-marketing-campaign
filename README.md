# Analyzing Marketing Campaign

This is a marketing campaign use case analysis. The dataset used is provided by Datacamp in the Analyzing Marketing Campaign with Pandas module.

In this project, I repeat what I have learned from the module with some changes and improvisations so this module and the story of this data can be more readable. 

Executive summary: 

🔧 What I do:

    📥 Importing the package we need and the dataset we want to analyze. 
    🔍 Examining the dataset 
    ⚙️ Transform the data 
    📊 Analyzing the data 

🎯 What I want to get: 

    There are several points that we will analyze: 
    
      📈 Daily reach marketing 
      💵 Total conversion rate
      🔁 Total retention rate
      📉 Daily conversion rate
      ✔️ Comparing conversion rate by language  
      📢 Conversion by marketing channel
      ✔️ Marketing channel across age groups 
      ⚙️ Function for conversion rate and plotting 
      ⚖️ Personalization A/B testing
      
 📒 Notes: at the end of the A/B testing part, in this project, we got an error. But, if we run this project on Google Collab all run well. I still can't figure out why.
